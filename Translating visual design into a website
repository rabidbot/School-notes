Translating visual design into a website. 

Html files are the structure of the house that is a website.  CSS is the decorations and stlyes you choose.  
Javascript is like your TV, interactive. 


Chrome browser builds a branching tree structure for html.  example Div->H2->span->text  


HTLM and CSS are both languages.   HTLM handles the structure of a page (frame in a house) CSS controls the style
(the brick and finishings you choose for the house)

DOM or Document Object Model is the tree like structure of a webpage.  A standard convention for interatcing and representing  elements in HTML

Broswers turn HTML tags into elements in the tree or DOM

Elements exist between <tag> and </tag>   whats inbetween those tags in contents. 


CSS  uses syntax and rules to change how the page looks


Notes on CSS

CSS= cascading style sheets.

CSS is code that controls the style (look) of HTML

You can have serveral CSS files. 

Avoiding repatition is a huge plus to CSS

With CSS the most specific rule is applied to all elements 
Descendant elements may inherit CSS property values from any ancestor element enclosing them


Div tags can have class ie <div class="title">
You can use the class or a tag as a selector.  The selector allows you to choose where to apply rules. 

CSS example

.class  {
	attribute: value;
}

tons of attributes for CSS 

link to doc sheet

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference

Rule: a line of CSS code describing the value that a certain attribute should take.

Property: The property you want to change.

The line of code that says
 background-color : black;

  is a declaration. 

  background-color

   is a property and 

   black

    is the value of that property.



Using in browser dev tools is a powerful way to help design and refine.
