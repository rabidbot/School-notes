    <strong>Basics of the web.</strong>

    <p>The web consists of a collection of personl computers and servers communticating
      <br> with each other via HTTP requets. The serve "serves up" the requested HTML where
      <br> it is interprated by your browser.

    <strong>HTML</strong>

    <p>Heart of the web.
      <br>
      <br> HTML consists of text content, markups, references to otther documents
      <br> and links to other pages.

    <strong>Computers, not so smart</strong>

    <p>Computers only have the ability to take everything
      <br> given to them literally. Mistakes matters and even little ones can cause failure.</p>

  <div>
    <strong> Span and Div </strong>

    <p> Div is a tag used to create blocks of code. Span is for inline code. Span can be used within a paragraph tag,
      <br> but div should not be. Div allows for changes within a block and span for changes within a specific line</p>

    <h2> Lesson 2: The Structure Within</h2>
    <!-- subtitled creating structure within an HTML document -->
  </div>
  <div>
    <strong>Block elements </strong>
    <p> Html elements are either block or inline. Block elements form a box around part of the web page your looking at.
      <br> It can be easy to visually take a web page and form boxes around each of the things you see. </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <strong>Looking at the code behind the block</strong>
    <p> Html exist in a tree like structure. Elements (or complete tags) existing inside of each other. HTML uses indentions to visually represent the nesting of boxes with in boxes.

  </div>
  <div>
    <strong> DOM </strong>
    <p>DOM or Document Object Model is the tree like structure of a webpage.  A standard convention for interatcing and representing  elements in HTML
      <br> Broswers turn HTML tags into elements in the tree or DOM
